Make: Projects Step Editor
==========================

Summary
-------

MAKE needs a tool that can both read, and write a data that exists as a result of the Make: Projects API. 

Requirements
------------

1. If this is a new project, when a user is on the projects edit screen, they have a meta box that allows them to upload up to three images, and step heading, and a then an unordered list of sub steps. They can add as many sub steps as needed.
2. When the post is saved, all of the steps are saved into a custom field array that matches the data structure of `print_r` of `$steps`.
